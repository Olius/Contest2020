It was nice that there were slightly fewer problems this year.  Even so,
I thought that the problems were slightly less algorithmically interesting
on the whole than previous years.  No DFSs, no graphs, etc.  The last two
problems were fun, but Balance was basically the knapsack problem, and Weights
was fun to arrayify and deloopify but was not a hard problem to solve.
Then again I like graphs and the like, and the problems this year were orig-
inal as always, so you did a good job.
P.S.: You really need to fix the SubmitMe function so it works acceptably with
the RIDE.  Last year it made my Dyalog crash (and because I had not run )SAVE
because I'm dumb, I lost a good day's work), and this year it failed to write
the required text into Contest2020.dyalog.
I'm starting to think that on *nix platforms such as my Mac, it's easier to
code APL in your favorite text editor and use git there, and only touch the RIDE
when you need to test your code.
