    ⍝ Sorry, the SubmitMe function does not seem to work with the RIDE on my
    ⍝ Mac, and I don't see the benefit of sticking "AboutMe,←⊂'...'" around each
    ⍝ line I write when I can just write them as comments.
    AboutMe←'See the .dyalog file.'
⍝ I've been participating in the APL competition since 2016, and began working
⍝ on my major in Math & CS at the University of Geneva, where I live, in 2017.
⍝ My interests in CS right now are floating around the functional languages,
⍝ as well as dependently typed theorem-prover things.  I don't know much but
⍝ one of the projects on my list of stuff to do is to write a typed APL.  First
⍝ however I'm going to try to crawl through the end of my bachelor's degree :)

    Reaction←'Again, see the .dyalog file.'
⍝ It was nice that there were slightly fewer problems this year.  Even so,
⍝ I thought that the problems were slightly less algorithmically interesting
⍝ on the whole than previous years.  No DFSs, no graphs, etc.  The last two
⍝ problems were fun, but Balance was basically the knapsack problem, and Weights
⍝ was fun to arrayify and deloopify but was not a hard problem to solve.
⍝ Then again I like graphs and the like, and the problems this year were orig-
⍝ inal as always, so you did a good job.
⍝ P.S.: You really need to fix the SubmitMe function so it works acceptably with
⍝ the RIDE.  Last year it made my Dyalog crash (and because I had not run )SAVE
⍝ because I'm dumb, I lost a good day's work), and this year it failed to write
⍝ the required text into Contest2020.dyalog.
⍝ It would have been much easier for me to write everything directly into the
⍝ .dyalog file, since I had to do so anyway.
