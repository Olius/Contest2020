 Balance←{

     ⍝ This problem is a special case of the classic knapsack problem.
     ⍝ Indeed, take as items the numbers given as input, with equal
     ⍝ values and costs, and set as allowance half the sum of the input.
     ⍝ The number can be separated into equal groups if and only if the
     ⍝ corresponding knapsack problem has a optimal solution whose value
     ⍝ reaches the allowance.

     half←2÷⍨+/⍵
