I've been participating in the APL competition since 2016, and began working
on my major in Math & CS at the University of Geneva, where I live, in 2017.
My interests in CS right now are floating around the functional languages,
as well as dependently typed theorem-prover things.  I don't know much but
one of the projects on my list of stuff to do is to write a typed APL.  First
however I'm going to try to crawl through the end of my bachelor's degree :)
